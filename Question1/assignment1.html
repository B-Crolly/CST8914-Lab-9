		<h1>ARIA Assignment 1</h1>
		<p>Your assignment is to replace the ARIA, where possible, on this page to HTML.</p>
		<p><strong>Note</strong>: All text was taken from <a href="http://fillerama.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fillerama</a>. Assume the semantics are correct; i.e., if it's marked up as a heading, it's a heading. If it's marked up as a list, it's a list. Don't fix the semantics. Just change from ARIA to HTML.</p>

			<h2>I'm a monster.</h2>
			<p>What's Spanish for "I know you speak English?" There's only one man I've ever called a coward, and that's Brian Doyle Murray. No, what I'm calling you is a television actor. I've opened a door here that I regret.</p>
			<p>Marry me. <strong>No, I did not kill Kitty.</strong> <em>However, I am going to oblige and answer the nice officer's questions because I am an honest man with no secrets to hide.</em> What's Spanish for "I know you speak English?"</p>

			<p>No… but I'd like to be asked! Bad news. Andy Griffith turned us down. He didn't like his trailer. I'm a monster. Bad news. Andy Griffith turned us down. He didn't like his trailer.</p>

			<h3>What's Spanish for "I know you speak English?"</h3>
			<p>That's what it said on 'Ask Jeeves.' Well, what do you expect, mother? Michael! We just call it a sausage. No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you.</p>

			<p>There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence. I don't criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense. I've opened a door here that I regret. Across from where?</p>
